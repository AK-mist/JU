Thread
  A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing.

Multitasking
  Multitasking is a process of executing multiple tasks simultaneously. We use multitasking to utilize the CPU. Multitasking can be achieved in two ways:
  
  1. Process-based Multitasking (Multiprocessing)
       * each process allocates a separate memory area
  2. Thread-based Multitasking (Multithreading)
       * share the same address space
