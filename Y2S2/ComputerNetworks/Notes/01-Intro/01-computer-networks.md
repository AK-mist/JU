# Computer Networks

*Definition*: A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices that communicate with each other to share resources and information.

## Types:

- LAN (Local Area Network): Covers a small geographic area, like a home, office, or building.
- WAN (Wide Area Network): Covers a broad area, such as cities, states, or countries (e.g., the Internet).
- MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): Spans a city or a large campus.
- PAN (Personal Area Network): Short-range network typically used for connecting personal devices.

## Components:

- *Nodes*: Devices like computers, smartphones, printers.
- *Links*: Physical (e.g., cables) or wireless (e.g., Wi-Fi) connections between nodes.
- *Protocols*: Rules for communication (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP).

## Topologies:

- *Bus*: All devices share a single communication line.
- *Star*: Devices connect to a central hub.
- *Ring*: Devices are connected in a circular fashion.
- *Mesh*: Devices are interconnected, with multiple pathways for data.

## OSI Model:

A framework for understanding network interactions in seven layers:

- *Physical*: Transmission of raw data bits.
- *Data Link*: Error detection and correction.
- *Network*: Routing of data packets.
- *Transport*: Reliable data transfer (e.g., TCP).
- *Session*: Managing sessions between applications.
- *Presentation*: Data translation and encryption.
- *Application*: Network services to end-users.
