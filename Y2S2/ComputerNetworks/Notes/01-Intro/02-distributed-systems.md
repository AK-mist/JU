# Distributed Systems

*Definition*: A distributed system is a network of independent computers that appear to the users as a single coherent system.

## Characteristics:

-  *Concurrency*: Multiple processes execute simultaneously.
-  *Scalability*: Ability to handle growth in workload.
-  *Fault Tolerance*: System continues to operate despite failures.
-  *Transparency*: Users perceive the system as a single entity.

## Types:

-  *Client-Server*: Clients request services, and servers provide them.
-  *Peer-to-Peer* (P2P): All nodes have equal status and share resources directly.
-  *Grid Computing*: Distributed computing over a grid of devices.
-  *Cloud Computing*: On-demand availability of computing resources over the Internet.

## Challenges:

-  *Consistency*: Ensuring all nodes have the same data.
-  *Coordination*: Synchronizing tasks across nodes.
-  *Latency*: Delays in data transmission.
-  *Security*: Protecting data and resources.

## Examples:

-  *Distributed Databases*: Databases spread over multiple servers (e.g., NoSQL databases like Cassandra).
-  *File Systems*: Distributed file storage (e.g., Hadoop HDFS).
-  *Microservices*: Architectural style where applications are composed of loosely coupled services.
